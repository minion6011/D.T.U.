# D.T.U. Data Terminal Unit [1.0.0]

D.T.U. (Data Terminal Unit) is a web-based terminal-style interface designed for managing data and files in a minimalist environment.
It provides functionality similar to cloud storage, but with a text-based approach and without the ability to create folders inside data directories: all files are managed in a flat structure.

## ✨ Key Features

- Secure access using a key (`login <key>` / `logout`).
- File and data management through data and file commands.
- Quick search with `search <term>`.
- Terminal-like environment.
